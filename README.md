### Unfolding Maps

This project is part of the [Object-Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java/home/info) Coursera course, developped by the University of California, San Diego.

The starter code is a skeleton to use Unfolding Maps in Eclipse (or any other IDE). A very basic Unfolding Map demo you'll find in the source folder in the default package. 
For more examples visit [Unfloding Maps](http://unfoldingmaps.org), or download the template with examples.

The module folders contain the starter code for the programming assignments associated with the MOOC. 
Get excited and make things!
